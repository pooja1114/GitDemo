@Before method and After method  are specified to particular class will execute before every and after every meyhod of that particular class
@Before class and @after class are specified to that particular class only will execute before and after in that class.
in testng order of text execution will depend on the test methods alphabetical order
wen client want to run only 4 test cases after every build so for that there is a concept called group in testn67
if some reqirement came like need to run this method before only tand this metthod after only we have one dependsOnMethods=
there is a scenario that we need to take screenshot for every test failure,so whenever a particular testcase failed u want to take the screenshot of it
but after every code u can't write the code for take screenshorts because after every code the test case fails teng have some intelligent mechanishm with
 the help of listeners,that wenever testcase fails it roots out testcase to some specific block so whenever testcase fails screenshot code will execute 
and screenshot,listener listens to your execution results wen it hear that something is failed den it will invoke one particular method and Itestlisterner
is an interface which have all the methos for this testng listener
so whenever the test fails the control of your execution come into that failure block as this class listens to whenever your testcase fails
on test start//on the beginning of test it will execute
on start
on finish
on testfailure//wen test is failed
on test skipped
on testsuccess//will execute wen the test is success
if u want to take screenshot wen your test is failed so write screenshot method in that failure method
wen running tesng xml need to tell where listeners class is locateddf



git and svn both are open source dustributed version control system


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
github is a cental place where we post our code so that any other person can come to office and take the latest code from the github(a place where we 
deposit our repository and people used to take it from der,cental reporsitory and we take code from der
X is working on some code A den push comment he pushed the code in repository so the next day Y come to office and took github have the intelligence of 
merging the code,github will look all the code and mange the code so automatically it takes all the code from different people and tries to merge and create 
one common code so that tommorow if anyone comes to offfice will take all the developed code
